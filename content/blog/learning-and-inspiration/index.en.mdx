Hello everyone! My personal website is now complete. During the process, I learned new techniques that I would like to share, along with some of the sites that inspired me.

## Tech Stacks
- [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app)：Multi-language support for the website.
- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)：A useful animation library that can simplify complex animation effects, which may be more difficult to achieve with tailwindcss alone.
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)：My website uses a MySQL platform to track **post views**.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)：This ORM library is designed for easy interaction with MySQL databases and provides intuitive APIs that simplify the database operation process.
- [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)：Manage the content of my blog posts and projects, and can easily define the information needed for a post, such as post title, description, release date, etc.

## Inspiration
I have learned from experience that UI design for a personal website can be time-consuming. When lacking inspiration, the following sites can provide a variety of options and save design time:
- [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)
- [Dark Mode Design](https://www.darkmodedesign.com)
- [Godly](https://godly.website/)
- [UI Verse](https://uiverse.io/)
- [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/components)

In addition, the following are some feature-rich personal websites with modern and beautiful UI design：
- [leerob.io](https://leerob.io)
- [delba.dev](https://delba.dev/)
- [jahir.dev](https://jahir.dev/)
- [honghong.me](https://honghong.me/)

## Conclusion
Learning is not only about acquiring new knowledge but also about applying it and continuously sharing it with others. This is why I was inspired to create this website, which allows me to share my ideas and receive feedback to grow together.
