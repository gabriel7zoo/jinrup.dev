Hello, I'm Tom Jin, Jin Zhengrong, a frontend engineer from Taiwan with a strong passion for website development. I currently work at Little Bear Technology, where I primarily use React and Ant Design to develop custom components and features for the company. I also use Next.js to work on both the frontend and backend systems of websites.

During my free time, I enjoy reading manga 📚, playing video games 🎮, playing basketball 🏀, and exploring new technologies in the tech field. I like to experiment with new technologies to create interesting projects.
