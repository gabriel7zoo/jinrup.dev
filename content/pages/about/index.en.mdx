Hi, I’m Maria, 17 years old, and someone who’s figuring out life one step at a time. I’m the co-founder of EMG, a project where I get to share ideas and create something that feels like it belongs to the future.

I’ve lived in Italy, France, and the UK, and each place has shaped me differently. Italy is where I feel most like myself, while France has given me the chance to step outside my comfort zone. I speak fluent Italian and French, and my English is a work in progress, but I think imperfections make us human.

Life at 17 feels like a mix of ambition and uncertainty, but I’m learning to trust the process and put my energy into things that matter, like my work at EMG. To me, it’s not just about ideas it’s about creating something meaningful, something “outside the world.”
