Hi, I'm Tom Jin, an engineer with over a year's experience in front-end development, currently working at [@ibears.io](https://ibears.io/), focusing on using React and Next.js, and currently practicing Typescript applications in my spare time. At work, I'm involved in both front-end and back-end dashboard development on websites, and these projects have improved my technical skills, as well as my collaboration and problem-solving abilities.

In my free time, I enjoy reading comics 📚, playing video games 🎮, playing basketball 🏀, watching movies, and reading and exploring new technologies in the software field.

Thank you for reading my profile, and feel free to contact me if you'd like to know more about my work experience or suggestions for the blog.
